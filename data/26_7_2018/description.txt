20/08/2018 (fldr: 26_8_2018, simulations: Q,R,S,T,V)
==============================
* Previious set worked OK. Gaved consistent results and all converged to a good fit 
* Constraint epsilon_I to be constant (position independent):
	model_ID == "constant_eps_I"
* Changed boundaries: 10kT maximum (in stead of 5 kT)
* Initial temp guess increased based on previous fits 
* 5 replicates (each on 20 cores) 


17/08/2018 (fldr: 26_8_2018, simulations: L,M,N,O,P)
====================
* Fits that did not work well ended up with some epsilon_I (mismatch penalties) being negative (turning into a gain instead). 
* constraint them to zero 
* 5 replicates (each on 20 cores).


12/08/2018 (fldr_26_7_2018, simulations: G,H,I,J,K)
=====================
* Started an additional 5 runs (will be gone this week anyways)




09/08/2018 (fldr_26_7_2018)
===========
* By accident started simulation C again. 
**** Renamed file to:               *** (to prevent it from being overwritten) 

* Started simulations D,E and F 


08/08/2018 (fldr:26_7_2018 simulation:D, E and F)
=========================
* Repeat simulation C  (Simulation worked, very good fit, not conclusivein terms of structure of energy landscape)  
* 3 additional replicates 


07/08/2018 (fldr:26_7_2018 simulation:C)
===========================
* found bug in previous run: Rates were allowed to be negative. 
* retry with only positive rates. 
* Had discussions with cluster maintainance guys. Apparently node-to-node communication was not actually working. 
* restarted simulation with 20 cores in total (19 + 1) 


31/07/2018 (fldr:26_7_2018 simulation:C)
========================
* simulation B: Better result (by eye) than simulation A
* Retry without using log-moves in Metropolis
* Use upper/lower bound of energies of Â±5kT (not 10kT as previous)
 




30/07/2018 (fldr:26_7_2018  simulation:B)
=====================
* checked results simulation A. Fit seemed to have worked
* Repeat with stricter tolerance: 1E-3 --> 1E-5 
* other settings the same 
* Adjusted code fit_landscape.py --> returns the time taken for the simulation
* !!! RENAME THE FILES BEFORE TRANSFERING TO OWN COMPUTER !!  (filename accidentally reused) 



26/07/2018 (simulation A)
==========================
* Made codes for preprocessing Boyle Data and adjusted Simmulated Annealing accordingly 
* Fit landscape without having equillibrium assumption for occupancy
* Relative steps 
* weights: Average values in each dataset (same as Koen) 
* cooling rate: 0.99
* Tstart: 0.1 
* initial condition: [5.0] + [5.0]*20 +[5.0]*20 +      [1.0] +    [100.]
* upper bound: [10.0] + [10.0]*20 + [10.0]*20 +    [100.]+    [1000.]
* lower bound: [0.0001]  + [0.0001]*20 + [0.0001]*20 + [0.0001] + [0.0001]
* model: 'general_energies' 
* 199x + 1x = 200x

27/07/2018 (simulation B):
====================
* Run on my laptop using 4 cores at least managed to produce the monitor & fit_result files. 
* Initial temperature: 169.28927393268415
* Another try without cross-node comunication: 20x (19 + 1) 
* set initial temperature close to 160.0 


26/07/2018 (retry simulation A):
=====================
* Apparently 'np.matmul()' is not recognised on cluster. Exchanged it for for np.dot()
