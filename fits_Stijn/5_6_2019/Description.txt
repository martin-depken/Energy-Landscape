Four state model fit, but now the M states are actual states and the combined rates are not used. Epsilon i are held constant, first 16 values are equal, and last 4 values are equal. forward rates over the flat parts are the base forward rates, over the barriers are reduced by the barrier. When a mismatch is in the barrier the barrier is heightened before calculating the forward rate. The backward rates are given by the forward rate times exp(energy-difference), so backward rates are changed by mismatches, and forward rates are not (except by increasing the barrier).
