Using the four-state reference fit, with constant epsilon i, we fit the eSpCas9 data. Left free are  R, kf2, and kclv. Fit to the average data, to make it extra fast.

first five: eSpCas9
second five: Hypa
third five: HF1

upper_bnd =      [10.0]  + [3.0]  + [3.0]
    lower_bnd =      [-10.0] + [-3.0] + [-1.0]
    initial_guess =  [0.0]   + [0.0]  + [1.0]
