The python code:
There are a number of files which are copies of the code of Behrouz and Misha, only with a few alterations to make it work in Python3. Those files have the same name, only with _Diewertje behind it. So this actually means 'python3'. This is the case for the following files:

analysis_SA_fits_Diewertje
Calculate_ABA_Finkelsteinlab_Diewertje
CRISPR_free_energy_landscape_Diewertje
CRISPR_Kinetic_model_Diewertje
get_paramters_fit_Diewertje
plotting_ABA_Diewertje			(for absolute ABA data)
plotting_ABA_Diewertje_deltaABA		(for delta ABA data)
plotting_Boyle_Diewertje
plotting_Finkelsteinlab_Diewertje
Weighted_Average_Diewertje
SimulatedAnnealing_Finkelstein_parallel (but now for python 3 again)


The following files are not copies from already existed code:

Calculate_Pbnd_2statesAssumption	To calculate the Occupancy if we have only 2 states.
Chisq_Finkelstein			To calculate the chi-squared for every fit (used for both absolute and delta ABA, in the file itself it is commented 					how to adjust this)
Chisq_F_Simple				To calculate the chi-squared for every fit when equilibrium is assumed, for absolute ABA data
Chisq_F_Simple_deltaABA			To calculate the chi-squared for every fit when equilibrium is assumed, for deltaABA data
Pipeline_fit_Finkelstein		The pipeline to execute the simmulated annealing to find a best fit. This is for rawABA data, used for Cas9 data
Pipeline_fit_Finkelstein_Simple		The pipeline to execute the simmulated annealing to find a best fit. This is for rawABA data, used for Cas9 data, 						assuming Equilibrium
Pipeline_fit_Finkelstein_cas12		The pipeline to execute the simmulated annealing to find a best fit. This is for delta ABA data, used for Cas12 data
Pipeline_fit_Finkelstein_cas12_eq	The pipeline to execute the simmulated annealing to find a best fit. This is for delta ABA data, used for Cas12 						data, assuming Equilibrium
plotting_simple_fit			The functions to plot the ABA for single mismatches, but now for the absolute ABA data. You still plot the deltaABA,  					but you now calculate this separately. 	(same functions as in plotting_ABA_Diewertje)
Prepare_data				To make lists with the MMposition, ABA and uncertainty with every measurement. FOR delta ABA data
Prepare_data_Simple			To make lists with the MMposition, ABA and uncertainty with every measurement. FOR absolute ABA data


3 sh-files to run the code on the cluster. all 3 work the same, I have 3 because I ran multiple jobs at the same time. But by only adjusting the path and the files it should work for all, there is nothing specific to them.

The jupyter notebooks:

2 state assumption test 		To test if the 2 state assumptions gives the correct occupancy
Compare Cas9 - Cas12			Comparison Cas9 and Cas12 + Comparison Cas9 Finkelstein and Boyle + plot thesis: difference experimental methods
Make WA out of data			To find the WA of the data, this is code that is also/can be added to the pipeline
make_jobs_Diewertje			To make the job file
To make the code faster			To see if we can use less concentration points and which combinations give the best results
