-> If molecule is not specified, it is Cas9

 	These simulations did not have a lower bound on epsilon_i, so it was allowed to be negative, for later simulations this is corrected
1_3_2019 			first try of simulation of the experiment of Finkelstein, using all 8 concentration points, using DELTA ABA data
1_4_2019			using all 8 concentration points, using the rawABA data
1_4_2019_simple 		using all 8 concentration points, using the rawABA data, assuming equilibrium, so using the boltzmann sum
8_4_2019_conc2 			using only 2 concentration points (which one are tested for in jupyter notebook file ...), using rawABA data
8_4_2019_conc3			using only 3 concentration points (which one are tested for in jupyter notebook file ...), using rawABA data
25_4_2019_conc3			... (I do not remember what the difference is with the previous one) ...

	From now on all the simulations have a lower bound for epsilon_i, so it cannot be negative
2_5_2019_fixedrates_conc3	using only 3 concentration points, using rawABA data, fixing the rates on the values found by simulation from Boyle
2_5_2019_var_rates_conc3	using only 3 concentration points, using rawABA data, letting the rates free to be determined by this simulation
15_5_2019_var_rates_conc3_eq	using only 3 concentration points, using rawABA data, letting the rates free to be determined by this simulation, asssuming
				equilibrium
19_5_2019_cas12_conc3		first simulation Cas12, using delta ABA data, but using the code as if it was raw ABA, so the command in green is added to 	
				the code, for if you want to change between rawABA data and deltaABA data (chi-squared code)
24_5_2019_cas12_conc3		using 3 concentration points, using delta ABA data combined with the code for delta ABA (chi-squared code)
26_5_2019_cas12_conc3_eq	using 3 concentration points, using delta ABA data combined with the code for delta ABA (chi-squared code), assuming 
 				equilibrium (so boltsmann sum)
27_5_2019_cas12_conc3_WA	using 3 concentration points, using delta ABA data combined with the code for delta ABA (chi-squared code), but now the fits  				are selected/compared to the weighted avarage of the data instead of the median
12_6_2019_cas12_conc8		using 8 concentration points, using delta ABA data combined with the code for delta ABA (chi-squared code), selection on WA
				(these results are not looked at yet during my thesis)
